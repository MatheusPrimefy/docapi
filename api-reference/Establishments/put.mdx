* Request type: **\[PUT]**

```json
https://api.premepay.com/v1/stores/:id
```

It's quite simple to update data for an Establishment using the Primefy API. By using the same parameters as in the establishment creation, you just need to send in the request the properties you want to update.

### Request example

* This is an example of how your request to update data for an establishment would look like.

```json
  {
  	"socialName": "Fast & Furious Transport",
    "phone": "(11) 99999-9119"
  }
```

### **Responses**

If your request is successful, you will receive the updated Establishment object as the response.

If your request has invalid creation parameters - for example, specifying an invalid field or value - you may receive an error response. Below is the complete list of possible error responses:

<Accordion title="401 Unauthorized">
  ```json
   This is the response for cases where the request was unsuccessful because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
   
    {
      "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/401",
      "title": "Unauthorized",
      "status": 401,
      "detail": null,
      "instance": null,
      "extensions": {}
    }
    
  ```
</Accordion>

> If needed, you can review our [authentication process](https://primefy-e56fa2d4.mintlify.app/api-reference/Authentication).

<Accordion title="403 Forbidden">
  ```json
  This is the response for cases where the request was forbidden. It occurs when the server can understand the request but refuses to authorize the issuance of an approval response.
    {
      "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/403",
      "title": "Forbidden",
      "status": 403,
