Primefy provides its users with the functionality to create personalized subscription plans. To customize your plans, you first need to create your subscription plan. Once you have your subscription plan created, you will only need to link the subscribing consumers, following the steps described in the Subscription plan section.

- Creating the plan allows the addition of different payment recurrence periods, according to the **Frequency Codes for Primefy Recurring Payments.** It is also possible to parameterize grace periods, trial periods and payment exemptions. That means you can:
- Implement subscription plans during the trial period;
- Enable your consumer to start paying for the subscription plan after a specific period;
- Add required users to access the subscription plan package, free of charge.
- Associating Products with a Plan.

The Subscription Plan can be associated with national and international consumers.

You can create a subscription plan using the route above.

If your request has invalid creation parameters - for example, specifying an invalid field or value - you may receive an error response. Below is the complete list of possible error responses:

- 400: Bad Request
    
    This is the answer for cases where the server does not process the request due to an error encountered. Some examples that can result in this error are a misspelled URL, malformed syntax, or invalid routing request.
    
    ```json
    {
        "errors": {
            "Frequency": [
                "The field Frequency is invalid."
            ]
        },
        "type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1",
        "title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
        "status": 400,
        "traceId": "|75017fc5-47c1fe46efb71345."
    }
    ```
    
- 401: Unauthorized
    
    This is the response for cases where the request was unsuccessful because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
    If needed, you can review our [authentication process](https://www.notion.so/Authentication-c941a0cb8e2647b187d87fcf8a314b37?pvs=21).****
    
    ```json
    
    {
        "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/401",
        "title": "Unauthorized",
        "status": 401,
        "detail": null,
        "instance": null,
        "extensions": {}
    }
    ```
    
- 403: Forbidden
    
    This is the response for cases where the request has been banned. This happens when the server can understand the request request, but does not authorize the issue of an approval response.
    
    ```json
    {
        "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/403",
        "title": "Forbidden",
        "status": 403,
        "detail": null,
        "instance": null,
        "extensions": {}
    }
    ```
    
- 500: Internal Server Error
    
    This is the answer for cases where an internal server error occurs.
    
    ```json
    {
        "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/500",
        "title": "Internal Server Error",
        "status": 500,
        "detail": null,
        "instance": null,
        "extensions": {}
    }
    ```
