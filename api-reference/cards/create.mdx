* 400: Bad RequestThis is the response for cases where the server does not process the request due to an error found in sending the information. Some examples that may result in this error are an incorrectly typed URL, malformed syntax, invalid routing request, or incorrectly provided data.Example 1: Card with invalid number


```json
  {
  	"errors": {
  		"CardNumber": [
  			"The CardNumber field is not a valid credit card number."
  		]
  	},
  	"type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1",
  	"title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
  	"status": 400,
  	"traceId": "|7500cc25-47c1fe46efb71345."
  }
  ```
  Example 2: Expiration month less than 1 or greater than 12
  
  ```json
  {
  	"errors": {
  		"ExpirationMonth": [
  			"The field ExpirationMonth must be between 1 and 12."
  		]
  	},
  	"type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1",
  	"title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
  	"status": 400,

  		"ExpirationYear": [
  			"The field ExpirationYear must be between 2000 and 3000."
  		]
  	},
  	"type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1",
  	"title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
  	"status": 400,
  	"traceId": "|7500cc3e-47c1fe46efb71345."
  }
  ```

    "title": "Forbiden",
    "status": 403,
    "detail": null,
    "instance": null,
    "extensions": {}
  }
  ```

* 500: Internal Server ErrorThis error is returned when an unhandled data is encountered, such as sending a string in a numeric field or trying to associate the card with a non-existent consumer.


```json
  {
  	"type": "https://httpstatuses.com/500",
  	"title": "Internal Server Error",
