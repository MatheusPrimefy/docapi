If your request has invalid creation parameters - for example, specifying an invalid field or value - you may receive an error response. Below is the complete list of possible error responses:

* 401: Unauthorized
This is the response for cases where the request was unsuccessful because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
  If needed, you can review our [authentication process](https://www.notion.so/Authentication-c941a0cb8e2647b187d87fcf8a314b37?pvs=21).\*\*\*\*

    "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/401",
    "title": "Unauthorized",
    "status": 401,
    "detail": null,
    "instance": null,
    "extensions": {}
  }
  ```

* 403: Forbidden

    "title": "Forbidden",
    "status": 403,
    "detail": null,
