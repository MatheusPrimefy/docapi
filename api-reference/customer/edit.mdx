title: "Edit customer"
openapi: "PUT https://api.premepay.com/v1/stores/:id/customers/:identification-number"
---

* Request type: **\[PUT]**

```json
https://api.premepay.com/v1/stores/:id/customers/:id
```

You can edit a customer to update their registration data or add missing information. For example, to generate a sale with PIX and Credit Card, you may not need the customer's address, but for issuing a Bank Slip, the Central Bank of Brazil requires this information.

Keeping your customers' data up-to-date is essential for the smooth operational functioning of your business.

**To update a customer's data, you need to provide all the values of that customer, even if there is no change for a specific value**. If any value is not provided, it will be considered as null.
