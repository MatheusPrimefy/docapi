    		"description": "descrição opcional",
    		"destination": 0,

### **Responses**

If your request is successful, you will receive the return of the Voucher object.

If your request has invalid creation parameters - for example, specifying an invalid field or value - you may receive an error in response. See below for the full list of possible responses.

- 200: OK
    
    ```json
    {
    		"id": 8,
        "endpoint": "url",
    		"description": "descrição opcional",
    		"destination": 0
        "events": [
            { "type": 0 },
            { "type": 1 },
            { "type": 2 },
            { "type": 3 },
    				{ "type": 4 },
    				{ "type": 5 },
    				{ "type": 6 }
        ]
    }
    ```
    
- 400: Bad Request
    
    This is the return informing the error message:
    
    ```json
    {
        "errors": {
            "Destination": [
                "The field Destination is invalid."
            ]
        },
        "type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.1",
        "title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
        "status": 400,
        "traceId": "|7502bf86-47c1fe46efb71345."
    }
    ```
    
- 401: Unauthorized
    
    This is the response for cases where the request was unsuccessful because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
    If needed, you can review our [authentication process](https://www.notion.so/Authentication-c941a0cb8e2647b187d87fcf8a314b37?pvs=21).****
    
    ```json
    {
      "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/401",
      "title": "Unauthorized",
      "status": 401,
      "detail": null,
      "instance": null,
      "extensions": {}
    }
    ```
    
- 403: Forbidden
    
    This is the response for cases where the request has been banned. This happens when the server can understand the request request, but does not authorize the issue of an approval response.
    
    ```json
    {
      "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/403",
      "title": "Forbidden",
      "status": 403,
      "detail": null,
      "instance": null,
      "extensions": {}
    }
    ```
    
- 500: Internal Server Error
    
    This is the answer for cases where an internal server error occurs.
    
    ```json
    {
        "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/500",
        "title": "Internal Server Error",
        "status": 500,
        "detail": null,
        "instance": null,
        "extensions": {}
    }
    ```
    

Below is the JSON object that the establishment will receive in its API (if registered as the destination) when a notification event is triggered:

```json
{
    "number": "P654762",
    "amount": "99.00",
    "status": "succeded",
    "payment": {
        "status": "succeded"
    },
    "paymentUrl": null,
    "metadata": {
        "test1": "test1",
        "test2": "test2"
    }
}
```

If the destination is one of the external tools, the object is a bit more comprehensive, as shown below:

```json
{
	"order": {
		"number": "P735831",
		"description": "Compra",
		"status": "Confirmado"
	},
	"customer": {
		"name": "Usuário Teste Exemplo 01",
		"identificationNumber": "52789024006",
		"email": "email@123.com",
		"phone": "(11) 12345-6789",
		"address": {
			"street": "Rua tal",
			"number": "123",
			"district": "Brás",
			"reference": "Casa",
			"zipcode": "02814000",
			"city": "São Paulo",
			"state": "SP",
			"country": "BR"
		}
	},
	"payment": {
		"installments": 3,
		"installment": 0, // só vai preenchido se for uma PARCELA de boleto
		"amount": "R$ 99,00",
		"type": "Cartão de Crédito",
		"status": "Confirmado",
		"receivedOn": "26/03/2022 06:38:32"
	},
	"metadata": {

		"teste2": "teste2"
	},
	"createdOn": "26/03/2022 06:38:31",

}
```
