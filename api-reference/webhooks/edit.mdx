### Request example

This is an example of what your request to update a webhook might look like.

* Body

  {
      "endpoint": "url alterada",
  		"description": "descrição opcional",
  		"destination": 0,
      "events": [

          { "type": 1 }
      ]
  }
```

### **Responses**

If your request is successful, you will receive the return of the webhook object.

If your request has invalid creation parameters - for example, specifying an invalid coupon or source - you may receive an error response. See below for the full list of possible responses.

* 200: OK

```json
  {
      "id": 38,
      "endpoint": "url alterada",
      "description": "descrição opcional",
      "storeId": 359,
      "destination": 0,
      "events": [
          { "type": 0 },
  				{ "type": 1 }
      ]
  }
```

* 400: Bad Request

```json
  {
      "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/400",
      "title": "Bad Request",
      "status": 400,
      "detail": "endpoint not found"
  }
```

* 401: Unauthorized

This is the response for cases where the request was unsuccessful because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
If needed, you can review our [authentication process](https://www.notion.so/Authentication-c941a0cb8e2647b187d87fcf8a314b37?pvs=21).\*\*\*\*

```json
{
  "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/401",
  "title": "Unauthorized",
  "status": 401,
  "detail": null,
  "instance": null,
  "extensions": {}
}
```

* 403: Forbidden

This is the response for cases where the request has been banned. This happens when the server can understand the request request, but does not authorize the issue of an approval response.

```json
  {
    "type": "https://httpstatuses.com/403",
    "title": "Forbidden",
    "status": 403,
    "detail": null,
    "instance": null,
    "extensions": {}
  }
```
